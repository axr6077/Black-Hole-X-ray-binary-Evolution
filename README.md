# Black-Hole-X-ray-binary-Evolution
Deep analysis of the galactic black hole x-ray binary GRS 1915+105 that contains a stellar-mass black hole and its evolution over the years 1992-2016. The studies would include but not limited to: tests of GT relativity in strong gravity, plasma physics in accretion discs and particle acceleration. The model promises to predict the extended evolution of this particular BHXRB by studing the light curves extracted over 4 energy bands using multi dimensional logistic regression and forest predictive algorithms.   

## Factors to consider 
* Superluminal projection (microquasar theory)- relativistic aberration
* Gas cloud ejection around the entity 
* High time variable
* Count Rate: production of false features at high frequencies in the power spectrum
* Fluctuating count rate due to proportional counter unit breakdown or missing data

## Important Observation
Unstable trends of count rate and R^2 at extreme wind column densities.
